The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\n liability of construction.\\n \\n LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\\n The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\n any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\n the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\\n all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\\n loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\n that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\n is reduced.\\n \\n All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\n full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\n the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\n non-recourse.\\n \\n USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\\n The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\n architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\n organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\\n many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\n Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\\n the estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n \\n EARLY LAND COSTS\\n The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\n represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\n extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\n probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\\n price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\n monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\n approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n \\n EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\\n Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\\n the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\n the \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\\n improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\\n improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\\n for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\n completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\n expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\n improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\n irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\\n development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\\n spent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n \\n The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\n finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\n high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\n per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\n which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\\n obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\n provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\\n improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\\n cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\n spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\n preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\\n tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\n significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n \\n Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\n lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\\n $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\\n improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\n costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\n landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\\n undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\n estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\n loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\n you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\n of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\n is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\n separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\n standpoint.\\n \\n CONSTRUCTION LOANS\\n There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\\n (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\n a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\n builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\n loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\n start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\n in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\\n construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\n difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n \\n Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\n pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\n be from 80% to 95% of value.\\n \\n DISBURSEMENTS\\n Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\\n near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\n payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\\n will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\\n fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\n These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\\n calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\n expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\\n to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\n cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\n function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\n from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\n Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\n used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\\n any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\n to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n \\n REPORTING\\n We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\n What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\\n reporting.\\n \\n BOOKKEEPING\\n I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\\n procedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\\n \\n INVESTOR INPUT\\n We are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As always\\n the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\\n experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\\n Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\\n effort to be accommodating.\\n \\n CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\\n CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\\n formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\\n obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\\n subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\\n for vendors they are constantly shopped.\\n \\n PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\\n Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\\n provide these if you are interested.\\n \\n I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

       " '\\r\\n \\r\\n ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/19/2000 \\n 04:35 PM ---------------------------\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n    \\n \\n Enclosed is the preliminary proforma for the Westgate property is Austin\\n that we told you about.  As you can tell from the proforma this project\\n should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\\n This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\\n Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\\n this market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\\n have uncovered to date in the Austin market.\\n The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\\n it is in the \"Smart Growth Corridor\" area designated by the City of Austin\\n for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\\n in less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\\n water treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\\n improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\\n Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\\n widening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\\n widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\\n requirement, I used this data to be cautious.\\n  The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\\n expected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\\n successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\\n adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\\n As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\\n is uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\\n only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\\n preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\\n preferences.\\n The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\\n an extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\\n plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\\n an A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\\n This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\\n profits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\\n having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity\\n with your profit in the lot.  I believe this would facilitate the use of a\\n 1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a\\n rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then\\n be the equity for that project.  You would need to discuss this with an\\n exchange expert first.  Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San\\n Antonio if you do not know anyone.\\n I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,\\n by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.\\n Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to\\n schedule a tour of the site and the area.  Please get back to me as soon as\\n your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any\\n time.  You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either\\n 512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110.  My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is\\n 512-338-1103.   I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you\\n on this project that is sure to be a major winner.\\n I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual\\n events these past few weeks.  A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg\\n downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.\\n One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to\\n start the next day.  The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough\\n to knock it down.  The City shut down the project for a week and it took\\n another week to get every thing back on tract.  Then last week I had to take\\n my wife  to emergency.  She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra\\n in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this\\n past week..  There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize\\n the enormous number of things she does everyday.   Fortunately, it looks as\\n if she will be ok in the long run.\\n George W.

Exodus is now wrapping up \\n construction\\n                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than \\n a mile from its\\n                   original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several \\n fiber optic backbones, the\\n                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \\n eventually\\n                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \\n Microsoft and Onvia.com. \\n \\n                        Exodus is not the only company building massive data \\n centers near Seattle.\\n                   More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \\n Globix and\\n                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \\n the networking\\n                   equipment of the Internet economy. \\n \\n                        It is a big business that could have an effect on \\n everything from your\\n                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \\n your favorite Web sites.\\n \\n                        Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \\n server farms, are\\n                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \\n Valley that some\\n                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \\n Puget Sound\\n                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \\n high-security\\n                   facilities. \\n \\n                        \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \\n are requesting 445\\n                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \\n said Karl\\n                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \\n Energy. \"That is\\n                   the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \\n \\n                        A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \\n the rise of the Internet\\n                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their \\n heads. \\n \\n                        Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \\n Utilities and\\n                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \\n data centers. The\\n                   tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing \\n residential and business\\n                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \\n necessary to support\\n                   the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \\n million each,\\n                   Karzmar said. \\n \\n                        Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \\n bring up the data center\\n                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \\n \\n                        For the utilities that provide power to homes, \\n businesses and schools in the\\n                   region, this is a new and complex issue. \\n \\n                        On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \\n appetite for power --\\n                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \\n facilities run 24 hours a\\n                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \\n constant revenue\\n                   stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \\n they could\\n                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \\n expenditures. \\n \\n                        Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \\n mean for power rates\\n                   in the area is still open to debate. \\n \\n                        \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \\n loads,\" said Bob Royer,\\n                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \\n City Light. \\n \\n                        \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \\n lights at the football\\n                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \\n We have data\\n                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \\n and 50 megawatts.\" \\n \\n                        With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \\n complex in Tukwila is\\n                   one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \\n the 1.35 million\\n                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \\n Boeing Space &\\n                   Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \\n 92 percent of the\\n                   six-building complex to seven different co-location \\n companies. \\n \\n                        \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \\n country,\" boasts Laurent\\n                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey.

Poole \\n claims his firm is\\n                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \\n the country. \\n \\n                        As more people access the Internet and conduct \\n bandwidth-heavy tasks\\n                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \\n co-location space in\\n                   Seattle continues to escalate. \\n \\n                        But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \\n space is growing at a\\n                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \\n causing similar\\n                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \\n California. \\n \\n                        Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \\n space, plans to nearly\\n                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \\n While companies\\n                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \\n high-tech companies\\n                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \\n as Exodus that\\n                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \\n management. \\n \\n                        \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \\n construction and we plan to\\n                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \\n demand right now\\n                   than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \\n executive at Exodus in\\n                   Seattle. \\n \\n                        The booming market for co-location space has left some \\n in the local utility\\n                   industry perplexed. \\n \\n                        \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \\n to serve the growth,\"\\n                   said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry is \\n almost stunned by this, in\\n                   a way.\" \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

The \\n WSCC data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \\n which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \\n the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \\n there can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \\n generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\\'t schedule their \\n generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \\n will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \\n munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \\n if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \\n schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \\n all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \\n the generation side.\\n \\n On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \\n they don\\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \\n better than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \\n load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\\n \\n I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \\n others up here once you have it finished.  I\\'d like to see how much gas \\n demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \\n especially compared to all gas consumption.  I was surprised by how small the \\n UEG consumption was compared to other uses.  If it is the largest marginal \\n consumer then it is obviously a different story.\\n \\n Let\\'s talk.\\n',\n",

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \\n an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \\n O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \\n get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \\n I'll take care of it..\\n \\n On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \\n curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \\n $235,019.   \\n (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \\n overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \\n something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \\n #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\\n   139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\\n   139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\\n   139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\\n   231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\\n   153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\\n  Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \\n GDP-Kingsgate.\\n \\n  Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \\n different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \\n withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \\n Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \\n that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \\n losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \\n I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \\n systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \\n that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \\n the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the \\n detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \\n appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be \\n an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar \\n impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in \\n case there's something you want to do about it.

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap.  I base this belief in large part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert.  Although the Chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\\n \\n Price caps are almost never the right answer\\n Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\\n Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer\\n Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce demand, is not acceptable\\n Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would export California\\'s problems to the West\\n \\n This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\\'s a pretty strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the agenda.  Hope this info helps.  Ray\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n 04/25/2001 02:28 PM\\n   \\n  \\n Are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting?

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \\n gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \\n Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \\n typical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \\n How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \\n contacts at SW Gas?\\n \\n We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \\n control of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \\n have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \\n commissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \\n commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \\n should look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \\n index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \\n risk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \\n their PGA's and see if there is an opportunity.\\n \\n As to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \\n there elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \\n appreciated.\\n \\n Thanks,\\n \\n Laird\\n \\n \\n\",\n",

Any possibility for a \\n deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \\n and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \\n reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \\n Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \\n bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \\n the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \\n the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \\n the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \\n Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \\n power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \\n bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \\n contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \\n loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \\n difficult.\\n \\n The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \\n would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \\n Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \\n billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \\n concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \\n disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the \\n details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \\n will support the bond issuance to go forward.\\n \\n Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \\n 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \\n passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \\n Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \\n community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \\n amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \\n currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should \\n get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \\n likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \\n  \\n According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \\n Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \\n available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \\n that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \\n Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \\n Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \\n Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \\n there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\\n  \\n Key Points of the Bridge Financing\\n Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\\n Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\\n    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\\n    Bear Stearns  $625 M\\n Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\\n Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\\n    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\\n Current Projected \\n Blended IR:  5.38%\\n Maturity  For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\\n \\n Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\\n The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \\n California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \\n authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \\n authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \\n additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \\n power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \\n authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \\n governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \\n amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \\n support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \\n 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \\n for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \\n the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \\n be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \\n idea  earlier in the crisis.\\n  \\n SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\\n At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \\n first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \\n governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \\n August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \\n to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \\n signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \\n and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \\n that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \\n bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \\n \\n The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \\n issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \\n stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \\n then the utilities would receive the residual amount.

Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook \\n client will be configured on your computer.\\n After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail \\n via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is \\n configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is \\n migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your \\n web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.\\n \\n PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and \\n To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook \\n client is configured on your desktop.\\n \\n 2. Remote access to your mailbox.\\n After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) \\n for remote access to your mailbox.\\n \\n PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while \\n connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA \\n available from your home or when traveling abroad.\\n \\n HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)\\n \\n Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  \\n http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe\\n \\n Substitute \"john.doe\" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You \\n will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in \"corp/your user \\n id\" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You \\n will now be able to view your mailbox.\\n \\n  \\n \\n PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between \\n the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things \\n in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the \\n functions NOT available via OWA:\\n \\n Features NOT available using OWA:\\n \\n -  Tasks\\n -  Journal\\n -  Spell Checker\\n -  Offline Use\\n -  Printing Templates\\n -  Reminders\\n -  Timed Delivery\\n -  Expiration\\n -  Outlook Rules\\n -  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall\\n -  Sharing Contacts with others\\n -  Task Delegation\\n -  Direct Resource Booking\\n -  Personal Distribution Lists\\n \\n QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?\\n \\n If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the \\n Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:\\n \\n\\n \\n Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:\\n \\n  713-853-1411\\n \\n Thank you,\\n \\n Outlook 2000 Migration Team\\n',\n",

Although the Chairman \\n began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or \\n answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had \\n some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\\n \\n Price caps are almost never the right answer\\n Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\\n Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer\\n Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce \\n demand, is not acceptable\\n Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would \\n export California\\'s problems to the West\\n \\n This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\\'s a pretty \\n strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner \\n out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and \\n if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the \\n agenda.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \\n March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \\n over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \\n temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \\n into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \\n compared with the previous year.\\n \\n Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \\n reductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \\n forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \\n total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \\n This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \\n more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \\n decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \\n retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \\n is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \\n year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \\n Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \\n are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \\n meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \\n economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \\n make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\\n \\n Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \\n only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \\n (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \\n portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \\n demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \\n you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \\n smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \\n least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \\n wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \\n mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \\n sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \\n how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \\n Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\\'s \\n economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \\n the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \\n think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \\n realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \\n non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \\n WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \\n 6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\\n \\n I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \\n with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \\n hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \\n questions or need any further information.\\n',\n",

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which \\n current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.\\n \\n Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this \\n project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design \\n and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of \\n our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or \\n rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? \\n \\n Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a \\n percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on \\n your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, \\n or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the \\n second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per \\n year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these \\n valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the \\n forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in \\n the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future \\n projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per \\n month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.?

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which \\n current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.\\n \\n Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this \\n project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design \\n and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of \\n our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or \\n rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? \\n \\n Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a \\n percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on \\n your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, \\n or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the \\n second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per \\n year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these \\n valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the \\n forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in \\n the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future \\n projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per \\n month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the \\n attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings \\n the total net buyout to $78,946.? \\n \\n We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we \\n offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout \\n offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are \\n prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? \\n If this is your \\n \\n \\n \\n choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, \\n Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then \\n draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the \\n Bishops Corner, Ltd.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the\\n project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market.  There are a\\n number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward\\n on the transaction.  First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a\\n Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market.   We adjusted\\n pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are\\n acheiving on the existing Sagewood project.  Additionally, there are about \\n 500+\\n units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, \\n this,\\n we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\\n effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested\\n loan amount to $8,868,000.\\n \\n I have summarized our issues as follows:\\n \\n 1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\\n \\n      Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment\\n      Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR\\n      2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475\\n      3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417\\n \\n 2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\\n turn over.\\n \\n 3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).\\n \\n 4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support\\n debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x \\n debt\\n coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.\\n \\n 5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.\\n \\n 6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide\\n equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:\\n \\n      Land -                   $1,121,670\\n      Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000\\n      Cash Equity              $1,419,268\\n      Total                    $2,955,938\\n \\n 7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage \\n of\\n actual hard construction costs.\\n \\n (See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  - MAPTTRA.xls\\n\",\n",

       " '\\r\\n \\r\\n Jaques,\\n \\n After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different \\n definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a \\n superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third \\n party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of \"construction management\" \\n fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be \\n paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally \\n the builders profit of 1.4 million.\\n \\n Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out \\n of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if \\n they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  \\n We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition \\n to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been \\n in the cost estimates that we have been using.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia\\n Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest\\n region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid\\n about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.\\n But that still wasn\\'t enough juice.\\n The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts\\n of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of\\n $250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts\\n of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the\\n $250/MWh price cap.\\n The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The\\n municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power\\n into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP\\n is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit\\n claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville\\n Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the\\n market at prices 10 times higher.\\n Powerex officials wouldn\\'t comment on the ISO power sale, saying all\\n transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000\\n megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts\\n - for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.\\n The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state\\n no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,\\n which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having\\n to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing\\n to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.\\n The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during\\n a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency\\n Wednesday, but wouldn\\'t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared\\n when the ISO\\'s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is\\n interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.\\n But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as\\n a means of attracting additional electricity resources.\\n \"In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,\"\\n Dorinson said.\\n Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy\\n unit (SRE) San Diego Gas & Electric, PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &\\n Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of\\n the high-priced power.\\n SoCal Edison and PG&E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high\\n wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by\\n nearly $1 billion, analysts said.

The entire\\n Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos\\n and Redondo Beach plants.\\n The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES\\n has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the\\n company $20 million for polluting.\\n \"We\\'d be happy to put our units back, provided we don\\'t get sued for it,\"\\n Thomas said. \"It\\'s not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality\\n district\\'s\" authority.\\n As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES\\n could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off\\n line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.\\n \\n    Dynegy\\'s El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC\\n \\n Dynegy Inc.

       " \"\\r\\n \\r\\n Jeff,\\n \\n Before you write off the stage, a few things to think about.\\n \\n 1.  Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and \\n repairs.  Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor \\n cost for repairs.  There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on \\n repairs.\\n \\n 2.  What is an outside management firm going to do?  A full time onsite \\n manager is all that is required.  As I mentioned the prior manager has \\n interest in returning.  Another alternative would be to hire a male manager \\n that could do more make readies and lawn care.  If you turn it over to a \\n management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager \\n onsite.\\n \\n 3.  Considering #1 & #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated.  If you \\n want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.\\n \\n 4.  Getting cash out is not a priority to me.  So I am willing to structure \\n this deal with minimum cash.  A 10% note actually attractive. See below.\\n \\n My job just doesn't give me the time to manage this property.  This property \\n definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.\\n \\n \\n Sales Price  705,000\\n \\n 1st Lien   473,500\\n \\n 2nd Lien  225,000\\n \\n Transfer fee    7,500\\n \\n Cash required   14,500\\n \\n \\n NOI   100,000\\n \\n 1st Lien    47,292\\n \\n 2nd Lien   23,694\\n \\n Cash flow  29,014\\n \\n Cash on cash  200%\\n \\n \\n These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then \\n cash on cash return would be more like 300%.   This doesn't reflect the \\n additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years \\n for a higher price.\\n \\n Do you want to reconsider?

Cash Needs\\r\\n Highlights:\\r\\n SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=\\r\\n plete=20\\r\\n cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20\\r\\n program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=\\r\\n s=20\\r\\n and other measures.=20\\r\\n Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20\\r\\n available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=\\r\\n .8=20\\r\\n million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20\\r\\n conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.\\r\\n II. Credit Relationships\\r\\n Highlights:\\r\\n SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20\\r\\n extend or renew credit as it has become due.\\r\\n At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.\\r\\n SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=\\r\\n lt.=20\\r\\n Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=\\r\\n nd=20\\r\\n payable.\\r\\n SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20\\r\\n indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.\\r\\n Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =\\r\\n its=20\\r\\n rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n issues within the last three weeks.\\r\\n III. Energy Cost Scenarios\\r\\n Highlights\\r\\n This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20\\r\\n various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=\\r\\n  such=20\\r\\n scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.\\r\\n IV. Cost Containment Initiatives\\r\\n Highlights\\r\\n SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.\\r\\n The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n improvement component as follows (in millions):\\r\\n Operating and maintenance costs     $ 77\\r\\n Capital Improvement Costs                383\\r\\n Total                                             $ 460\\r\\n The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=\\r\\n om=20\\r\\n contract employees.\\r\\n Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n most part being deferred to a future date.\\r\\n SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20\\r\\n executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20\\r\\n savings of approximately $92 million.\\r\\n V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20\\r\\n Activity)\\r\\n Highlights:\\r\\n As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20\\r\\n Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20\\r\\n includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20\\r\\n million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.\\r\\n As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.\\r\\n Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=\\r\\n e=20\\r\\n end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20\\r\\n D.01-01-018.\\r\\n Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20\\r\\n generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20\\r\\n tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20\\r\\n expressed in the TRA, are overstated.\\r\\n TURN Proposal\\r\\n As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=\\r\\n RN=20\\r\\n to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=\\r\\n s.=20\\r\\n Our comments are summarized as follows:\\r\\n The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=\\r\\n t=20\\r\\n would not directly generate nor use cash.\\r\\n The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=\\r\\n ift=20\\r\\n costs between two regulatory assets.\\r\\n TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=\\r\\n  the=20\\r\\n revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =\\r\\n in=20\\r\\n the TRA is overstated.\\r\\n VI. Flow of Funds Analysis\\r\\n Highlights:\\r\\n In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.\\r\\n During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.\\r\\n Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=\\r\\n on=20\\r\\n stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=\\r\\n ve=20\\r\\n and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.\\r\\n [there is no Section VII]\\r\\n =20\\r\\n VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates\\r\\n SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20\\r\\n In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=\\r\\n =20\\r\\n This increase correlates to the increase in market prices\\r\\n for natural gas for the same period.\\r\\n A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20\\r\\n www.cpuc.ca.gov.\\r\\n =20\\r\\n Dan\\r\\n \\r\\n',\n",

       " '\\r\\n \\r\\n By STEVE EVERLY - The Kansas City Star\\n  \\n As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile \\n Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas \\n storage number. \\n \\n The storage figures showed utilities withdrawing huge amounts of gas, and the \\n forecast was for frigid weather. Traders put the two together, anticipated a \\n supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. \\n \\n \"Traders do that all the time; they\\'re looking forward,\" said William Burson, \\n a trader. \"It makes the market for natural gas.\" \\n \\n But the market\\'s response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas \\n Association\\'s director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the \\n storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the \\n numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than \\n reality. \\n \\n \"It\\'s a little frustrating that they don\\'t take the time to understand what \\n we are reporting,\" McGill said. \\n \\n As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- \\n and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing \\n fingers at Wall Street. \\n \\n Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently \\n stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market\\'s speculators for \\n the rise in gas prices. \\n \\n \"It\\'s my firm belief ... that today\\'s gas prices are being manipulated,\" Adik \\n told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. \\n \\n In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric \\n utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. \\n \\n Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame \\n for this winter\\'s startling gas bills, having failed to protect their \\n customers and constituents from such price spikes. \\n \\n Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take \\n precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price \\n insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas \\n prices before they soared. \\n \\n \"We\\'re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,\" said Paul \\n Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. \\n \\n But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. \\n \\n \"There\\'s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to \\n change,\" said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security \\n Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. \\n \\n \\n Hot topic \\n \\n Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In \\n many circles, little else is discussed. \\n \\n The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is \\n facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the \\n previous December\\'s bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as \\n well. \\n \\n The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of \\n his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial \\n pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. \\n \\n \"It\\'s the talk of the town here,\" he said. \\n \\n A year ago that wasn\\'t a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per \\n thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn\\'t make it worthwhile \\n to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by \\n customers. \\n \\n But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand \\n cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage \\n for winter. \\n \\n There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, \\n prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information \\n Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating \\n bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. \\n \\n But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, \\n including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas \\n markets. \\n \\n \"It\\'s all about the weather,\" said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. \\n \\n Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York \\n traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile \\n commodity in the world. \\n \\n \\n Setting the price \\n \\n In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of \\n gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading \\n contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had \\n widespread influence over gas prices. \\n \\n The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon \\n as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale \\n prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from \\n utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what \\n they pay for the gas they expect to use. \\n \\n There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention \\n of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge \\n of natural gas. \\n \\n But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don\\'t need to \\n know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they\\'re trading. Like all \\n futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to \\n their volatility and to the traders\\' ability to make or lose a lot of money \\n in a short time. \\n \\n As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less \\n than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. \\n Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association\\'s \\n weekly storage numbers. \\n \\n Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to \\n need in the winter. \\n \\n Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than \\n average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in \\n hopes that the summer\\'s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. \\n \\n Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be \\n sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the \\n concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. \\n \\n Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage \\n numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the \\n association\\'s McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. \\n \\n But some utility executives didn\\'t share that view. William Eliason, vice \\n president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December\\'s cold snap had \\n continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. \\n \\n \"I was getting worried,\" he said. \\n \\n Then suddenly the market turned when January\\'s weather turned warmer. \\n Wednesday\\'s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices \\n dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. \\n \\n \\n Just passing through \\n \\n Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but \\n pass their fuel costs on to customers. \\n \\n Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers\\' cost-of-gas \\n charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas \\n Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. \\n \\n Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last \\n month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could \\n be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve \\n energy. \\n \\n Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to \\n save an average customer about $25 this winter. \\n \\n Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an \\n extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not \\n guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. \\n \\n Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left \\n customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether \\n they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel \\n costs. \\n \\n On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public \\n Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to \\n perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy\\'s gas purchasing practices. \\n \\n \"Consumers are taking all the risk,\" Micheel said. \"It\\'s time to consider \\n some changes.\" \\n \\n \\n To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n --\\n All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star  ',\n",

In attendance were Ken Lay, \\n the Governor, the Governor\\'s staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov. \\n spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his \\n ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next \\n week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.  \\n Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on \\n my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff \\n Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our \\n proposals, the governor\\'s ideas, as well as my overview of the situation \\n based on the governor\\'s comments:\\n \\n Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that \\n we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing \\n communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to \\n go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what \\n the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more \\n work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He \\n talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail \\n level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the \\n benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he \\n would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power \\n (which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented \\n solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix \\n the problem by \\'02 and provide some political cover.\\n Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also \\n included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed \\n interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a \\n goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities \\n to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate \\n analysts and other \"nonadvocates\" to develop solutions to a number of issues \\n including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.  \\n He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas \\n purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding \\n some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.\\n His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously \\n under serious consideration and some of which were mere \"brainstorming\".  \\n Some of these ideas would require legislative action.\\n State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a \"couple\" of \\n generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that \\n they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This \\n was a frequently recurring theme.\\n Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus \\n basis to consumers.\\n Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in \\n California.\\n State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more \\n widely deploy distributed generation.\\n Expand in-state gas production.\\n Take state lands gas royalties in kind.\\n negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for \\n addtional gas supplies.\\n Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant \\n maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at \\n any one time.\\n Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.\\n Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear \\n more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder\\'s group should be \\n able to help out here).\\n Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made \\n some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy \\n some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation \\n thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control \\n approach with generators.\\n Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.\\n To dos: (Jeff, again I\\'d like to prevail on you to assemble the group\\'s \\n thoughts and get them to Kari)\\n He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- \\n not just the 5 one year strips.\\n He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.\\n He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the \\n deal.\\n He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the \\n forward contracting issues.\\n Thanks to everyone for their help.

Can you please send it to him.  His contact information is:  phone \\n\\n \\n  I know Larry has been working with a bank and they need my information.  I \\n hope to pull that together this afternoon.\\n \\n  I took the liberty of calling Thomas Reames from the Frog Pond document.  He \\n was positive about his experience overall.  He did not seem pleased with the \\n bookkeeping or information flow to the investor.  I think we should discuss \\n these procedures in advance.\\n \\n  Let's continue to speak or email frequently as new developments occur.\\n \\n Phillip\",\n",
       " '\\r\\n \\r\\n Jim,\\n \\n  I would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project I \\n described to you last week.  The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in \\n San Marcos.  There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a \\n couple of other investors involved.  As I mentioned last week, I would like \\n to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not \\n require the investors to personally guarantee.  If there is a creative way to \\n structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions.  One idea that has \\n been mentioned is to obtain a \"forward commitment\" in order to reduce the \\n equity required.  I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this \\n nature are normally financed.  Specifically, the transition from interim to \\n permanent financing.  I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be \\n important to banks. \\n \\n  I am faxing you a project summary.  And I will have the builder/developer \\n email or fax his financial statement to you.\\n \\n  Let me know what else you need.  The land is scheduled to close mid January.\\n \\n \\n Phillip Allen',\n",
       " \"\\r\\n \\r\\n Jeff,\\n \\n Everything should be done for closing on the Leander deal on the 29th.  I \\n have fed ex'd the closing statements and set up a wire transfer to go out \\n tomorrow.    When will more money be required?  Escrow for roads?  Utility \\n connections?  Other rezoning costs?  \\n \\n What about property taxes?  The burnet land lost its ag exemption while I \\n owned it.  Are there steps we can take to hold on to the exemption on this \\n property?  Can you explain the risks and likelihood of any rollback taxes \\n once the property is rezoned?  Do we need to find a farmer and give him \\n grazing rights?\\n \\n What are the important dates coming up and general status of rezoning and \\n annexing?  I am worried about the whole country slipping into a recession and \\n American Multifamily walking on this deal.  So I just want to make sure we \\n are pushing the process as fast as we can.\\n \\n Phillip\",\n",
       " \"\\r\\n \\r\\n Steve,\\n \\n \\n I am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail.  If \\n you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n As far as recommendations, here is a short list:\\n \\n  1.  Examine LDC's incentive rate program.  Current methodology rewards sales \\n above monthly index without enough consideration of future \\n       replacement cost.  The result is that the LDC's sell gas that should be \\n injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.\\n                     This creates a shortage in later months.\\n \\n  2.  California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet \\n demand.  Investigate why it wasn't maximized operationally.  \\n                       Specific questions should include:  \\n \\n   1.  Why in March '00-May '00  weren't total system receipts higher in order \\n to fill storage?\\n \\n   2.  Why are there so many examples of OFO's on weekends that push away too \\n much gas from Socal's system.  \\n        I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their \\n own demand.  They repeatedly estimated they would receive       more gas than \\n their injection capablity, but injected far less.\\n \\n  3.  Similar to the power market,  there is too much benchmarking to short \\n term prices.  Not enough forward hedging is done by the major \\n                     LDCs.  By design the customers are short at a floating \\n rate.  This market has been long historically.  It has been a buyers market \\n and the \\n      consumer has benefitted.  \\n \\n \\n Call me if you need any more input.\\n \\n \\n Phillip\",\n",

Note that the\\n construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our\\n standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio\\n of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.\\n \\n Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs\\n are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have\\n actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf\\n without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.\\n \\n It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly\\n sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.\\n \\n I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are\\n $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3\\n bedroom.

Any possibility for a=\\r\\n  deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republic=\\r\\n ans and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic cauc=\\r\\n us is reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republic=\\r\\n ans and Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, o=\\r\\n nce the bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double=\\r\\n  dip\" into the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the leg=\\r\\n islature and the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses th=\\r\\n e details of the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take plac=\\r\\n e.  Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the lon=\\r\\n g-term power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require t=\\r\\n hat the bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in =\\r\\n breach of contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass th=\\r\\n e bridge loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st wi=\\r\\n ll be very difficult.\\r\\n \\r\\n The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the stat=\\r\\n e would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General=\\r\\n  Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately =\\r\\n $8 billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this =\\r\\n concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for ful=\\r\\n l disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the =\\r\\n details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they=\\r\\n  will support the bond issuance to go forward.\\r\\n \\r\\n Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB =\\r\\n 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bi=\\r\\n ll passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lac=\\r\\n k of Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs fo=\\r\\n r community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be am=\\r\\n ended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, curre=\\r\\n ntly in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should get =\\r\\n paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be li=\\r\\n kely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy).=20\\r\\n =20\\r\\n According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, Republic=\\r\\n ans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in =\\r\\n the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated that only 1/2 =\\r\\n of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  Other Republ=\\r\\n icans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The Republicans intend=\\r\\n  to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, Lehman Brothers repo=\\r\\n rtedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some ind=\\r\\n ications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\\r\\n =20\\r\\n Key Points of the Bridge Financing\\r\\n Initial Loan Amount:=09$4.125 B\\r\\n Lenders:=09=09JP Morgan=09=09$2.5 B\\r\\n =09=09=09Lehman Brothers=09=09$1.0 B\\r\\n =09=09=09Bear Stearns=09=09$625 M\\r\\n Tax Exempt Portion:=09Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\\r\\n Projected Interest Rate:=09Taxable Rate=09=095.77%\\r\\n =09=09=09Tax-Exempt Rate=09=094.77%\\r\\n Current Projected=20\\r\\n Blended IR:=09=095.38%\\r\\n Maturity  For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\\r\\n \\r\\n Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\\r\\n The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create t=\\r\\n he California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion=\\r\\n  authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be aut=\\r\\n horized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the addi=\\r\\n tional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power =\\r\\n going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these authoriz=\\r\\n ations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the governor =\\r\\n has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond amount is =\\r\\n that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support.   No f=\\r\\n urther action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB 6X until it =\\r\\n is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  for purchas=\\r\\n ing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  the Calif=\\r\\n ornia Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  be consi=\\r\\n dered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this idea  earl=\\r\\n ier in the crisis.\\r\\n =20\\r\\n SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\\r\\n At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  T=\\r\\n he first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the =\\r\\n governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is Au=\\r\\n gust 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According t=\\r\\n o sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has s=\\r\\n igned it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davi=\\r\\n s and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicat=\\r\\n es that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary bank=\\r\\n ruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. =20\\r\\n \\r\\n The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond is=\\r\\n suance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) s=\\r\\n tating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, th=\\r\\n en the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the st=\\r\\n ate will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and p=\\r\\n assed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for=\\r\\n  bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and=\\r\\n  the DWR proportionately from rate payments.\\r\\n \\r\\n',\n",

       " '\\r\\n \\r\\n ---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 10/24/2000 \\n 01:29 PM ---------------------------\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n \\n STRUCTURE:\\n Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\\n general partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\\n liability of construction.\\n \\n LAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\\n The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\\n any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\\n the name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\\n all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\\n loans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\\n that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\\'s share of profits\\n is reduced.\\n \\n All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\\n full recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\\n the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\\n non-recourse.\\n \\n USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\\n The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\\n architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\\n organization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\\n many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\\n Creekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\\n the estimated 6 month design and approval period.\\n \\n EARLY LAND COSTS\\n The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\\n represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\\n extensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\\n probably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\\n price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\\n monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\\n approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\\n \\n EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\\n Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\\n the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\\n the \"fiscals\".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\\n improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\\n improvements have been completed and accepted by COA.  This release will be\\n for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after\\n completion.  Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should\\n expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot\\n improvement construction.  These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an\\n irrevocable letter of credit.  As such, they have to be counted as a\\n development cost, even though they are not spent.  Because they are not\\n spent no interest is charged on these funds.\\n \\n The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a\\n finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as\\n high as $25,000.  This would produce a loan amount of  $15,000 on $20,000\\n per lot.  With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, \\'fiscals\\' at\\n $2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000\\n which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity.  The investment prior to\\n obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement\\n provided it was for direct costs.  Thus, the additional equity for the\\n improvement loan would be $0-$184,000.   Even if the maximum loan would\\n cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds\\n spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the\\n preliminary proforma to be on the safe side.  The engineer is preparing a\\n tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can\\n significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.\\n \\n Phasing works as follows.  If the first phase was say 40 units, the total\\n lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot.   Of this, probably\\n $13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost.  The\\n improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design\\n costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and\\n landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land.  The land loan for\\n undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would\\n estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot.  Then the\\n loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot.  This would give\\n you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required\\n of $241,000.  This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing\\n is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the\\n separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility\\n standpoint.\\n \\n CONSTRUCTION LOANS\\n There are three types of  construction loans.  First, is a speculative\\n (spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity.  Second,  is\\n a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the\\n builder/developers name.  Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction\\n loan in the name of the buyer.  We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to\\n start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans\\n in the name of the builder/developer.  We do not expect to have any\\n construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too\\n difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.\\n \\n Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for\\n pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender,  will\\n be from 80% to 95% of value.\\n \\n DISBURSEMENTS\\n Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and\\n near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority\\n payments and then to the partners per the agreement.  The General Partner\\n will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the\\n fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to\\n 15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.\\n These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to\\n calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership\\n expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has\\n to perform.  For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or\\n cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this\\n function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain\\n from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.\\n Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is\\n used in lieu of leasing equipment from others.  At present CB does not own\\n any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track\\n to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.\\n \\n REPORTING\\n We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.\\n What did you have in mind?  I would like to use some form of internet based\\n reporting.\\n \\n BOOKKEEPING\\n I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, \"Bookkeeping\\n procedures to record actual expenses?\"  Please expand.\\n \\n INVESTOR INPUT\\n We are glad to have the investor\\'s input on design and materials.  As always\\n the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my\\n experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume\\n Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every\\n effort to be accommodating.\\n \\n CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES\\n CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as\\n formal as your question indicates.  In the EXTREMELY tight labor market\\n obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible.  For the professional\\n subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport.  Finally,\\n for vendors they are constantly shopped.\\n \\n PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS\\n Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can\\n provide these if you are interested.\\n \\n I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

Exodus is now wrapping up \\n construction\\n                   on a new 13-acre, 576,000-square-foot data center less than \\n a mile from its\\n                   original facility. Sitting at the confluence of several \\n fiber optic backbones, the\\n                   Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \\n eventually\\n                   house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \\n Microsoft and Onvia.com. \\n \\n                        Exodus is not the only company building massive data \\n centers near Seattle.\\n                   More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \\n Globix and\\n                   HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \\n the networking\\n                   equipment of the Internet economy. \\n \\n                        It is a big business that could have an effect on \\n everything from your\\n                   monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \\n your favorite Web sites.\\n \\n                        Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \\n server farms, are\\n                   sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \\n Valley that some\\n                   have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \\n Puget Sound\\n                   Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \\n high-security\\n                   facilities. \\n \\n                        \"We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \\n are requesting 445\\n                   megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,\" \\n said Karl\\n                   Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \\n Energy. \"That is\\n                   the equivalent of six oil refineries.\" \\n \\n                        A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \\n the rise of the Internet\\n                   data center has some utility veterans scratching their \\n heads. \\n \\n                        Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington \\n Utilities and\\n                   Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new \\n data centers. The\\n                   tariff is designed to protect the company\\'s existing \\n residential and business\\n                   customers from footing the bill for the new base stations \\n necessary to support\\n                   the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 \\n million each,\\n                   Karzmar said. \\n \\n                        Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to \\n bring up the data center\\n                   issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. \\n \\n                        For the utilities that provide power to homes, \\n businesses and schools in the\\n                   region, this is a new and complex issue. \\n \\n                        On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing \\n appetite for power --\\n                   represent potentially lucrative business customers. The \\n facilities run 24 hours a\\n                   day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a \\n constant revenue\\n                   stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that \\n they could\\n                   potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital \\n expenditures. \\n \\n                        Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will \\n mean for power rates\\n                   in the area is still open to debate. \\n \\n                        \"These facilities are what we call extremely dense \\n loads,\" said Bob Royer,\\n                   director of communications and public affairs at Seattle \\n City Light. \\n \\n                        \"The entire University of Washington, from stadium \\n lights at the football\\n                   game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. \\n We have data\\n                   center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 \\n and 50 megawatts.\" \\n \\n                        With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate \\n complex in Tukwila is\\n                   one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased \\n the 1.35 million\\n                   square-foot Intergate East facility last September from \\n Boeing Space &\\n                   Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased \\n 92 percent of the\\n                   six-building complex to seven different co-location \\n companies. \\n \\n                        \"It is probably the largest data center park in the \\n country,\" boasts Laurent\\n                   Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG \\n Communications,\\n                   NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama \\n Networks all\\n                   lease space in the office park. \\n \\n                        After building Exodus\\' first Tukwila facility in 1997, \\n Sabey has become an\\n                   expert in the arena and now has facilities either under \\n management or\\n                   development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole \\n claims his firm is\\n                   one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in \\n the country. \\n \\n                        As more people access the Internet and conduct \\n bandwidth-heavy tasks\\n                   such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for \\n co-location space in\\n                   Seattle continues to escalate. \\n \\n                        But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center \\n space is growing at a\\n                   rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, \\n causing similar\\n                   concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and \\n California. \\n \\n                        Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location \\n space, plans to nearly\\n                   double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. \\n While companies\\n                   such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many \\n high-tech companies\\n                   have decided to outsource the operations to companies such \\n as Exodus that\\n                   may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic \\n management. \\n \\n                        \"We have 2 million square feet of space under \\n construction and we plan to\\n                   double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more \\n demand right now\\n                   than data center space,\" said Steve Porter, an account \\n executive at Exodus in\\n                   Seattle. \\n \\n                        The booming market for co-location space has left some \\n in the local utility\\n                   industry perplexed. \\n \\n                        \"It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do \\n to serve the growth,\"\\n                   said Seattle City Light\\'s Royer. \"The utility industry is \\n almost stunned by this, in\\n                   a way.\" \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n',\n",

Note that the\\n construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our\\n standard rate of 10%.  This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio\\n of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.\\n \\n Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs\\n are high.  Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have\\n actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf\\n without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.\\n \\n It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876.  However, I am fairly\\n sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.\\n \\n I hope to finish the proforma today.  The rental rates that we project are\\n $1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3\\n bedroom.

The \\n WSCC data, which is dicey and we don\\'t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, \\n which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources.  For your purposes \\n the CAISO may suffice.  I think that you probably know this already, but \\n there can be a siginificant difference between \"scheduled\" and \"actual\" \\n generation.  You are pulling \"scheduled.\"  If someone doesn\\'t schedule their \\n generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you \\n will miss that.  You may also miss generation of the northern california \\n munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso.  That is, \\n if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply \\n schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW.  Having said \\n all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on \\n the generation side.\\n \\n On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load.  While \\n they don\\'t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is \\n better than the \"scheduled\" number.  The utilities play lots of game on the \\n load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.\\n \\n I think the presentation looks good.  It would be useful to share this with \\n others up here once you have it finished.  I\\'d like to see how much gas \\n demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, \\n especially compared to all gas consumption.

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be \\n an issue, but I'll point it out and let you decide.  Let me know if this is \\n O.K. as is, so I'll know to ignore it in the future.  Also, if you want me to \\n get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and \\n I'll take care of it..\\n \\n On PG&E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate \\n curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of \\n $235,019.   \\n (If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&l--not change your \\n overall p&l.)  Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects \\n something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal \\n #'s, paths and p&l impacts of each.\\n   139195  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($182,030)\\n   139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora   ($    4,024)\\n   139197  From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin    ($    8,271)\\n   231321  From Kingsgate to Malin     ($  38,705)\\n   153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield    ($     1,988)\\n  Suggested fix:  Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to \\n GDP-Kingsgate.\\n \\n  Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five \\n different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for \\n withdrawals and the other four are injections.  Clay Basin is valued as a \\n Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points.  What this means is \\n that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport \\n losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport.  \\n I'm not sure of the best way to handle this since we don't really have a \\n systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals.  In an ideal world, it seems \\n that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, \\n the transport cost would pass through as storage costs.  Anyway, here's the \\n detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it \\n appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin.  There may be \\n an operational reason why this occurred that I'm not aware of, and the dollar \\n impact is very small, but I thought I'd bring it to your attention just in \\n case there's something you want to do about it.

Any possibility for a \\n deal has reportedly fallen apart.  According to sources, both the Republicans \\n and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis.  The Democratic caucus is \\n reportedly \"unwilling to fight\" for Davis.  Many legislative Republicans and \\n Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the \\n bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would \"double dip\" into \\n the fund.  Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and \\n the governor.  However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of \\n the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place.  \\n Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term \\n power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the \\n bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001.  If not, the state may be in breach of \\n contract.  Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge \\n loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very \\n difficult.\\n \\n The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state \\n would \"eat\" the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General \\n Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 \\n billion.  However, the reportedly now are not  going to offer even this \\n concession.  Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full \\n disclosure of the governor\\'s plan for handling the crisis, including the \\n details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they \\n will support the bond issuance to go forward.\\n \\n Currently there are two bills dealing  with the bridge  loan; AB 8X and AB \\n 31X.  AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds.  This bill \\n passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of \\n Republican support.  AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for \\n community college districts.  However, sources report this bill may be \\n amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, \\n currently in AB 8X.  Senator  Bowen\\'s language states that the state should \\n get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be \\n likely to cause a SoCal  bankruptcy). \\n  \\n According to sources close to the Republicans in  the legislature, \\n Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money \\n available in the General Fund.  For instance, Tony  Strickland has stated \\n that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion)  should be issued.  \\n Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any  bonds.  The \\n Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on  Monday.  Additionally, \\n Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a  bridge loan is unnecessary and \\n there are some indications that Lehman may  back out of the bridge loan.\\n  \\n Key Points of the Bridge Financing\\n Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B\\n Lenders:  JP Morgan  $2.5 B\\n    Lehman Brothers  $1.0 B\\n    Bear Stearns  $625 M\\n Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt\\n Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate  5.77%\\n    Tax-Exempt Rate  4.77%\\n Current Projected \\n Blended IR:  5.38%\\n Maturity  For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510\\n \\n Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time\\n The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5  billion to create the \\n California Consumer Power and Conservation  Authority.    The $5 billion \\n authorized under SB 6X is not the  same as the $5 billion that must be \\n authorized by the legislature to pay for  power already purchased, or the \\n additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing \\n power going forward.  Again, the Republicans are not in support of these \\n authorizations.  Without the details of the long-term power contracts the \\n governor has  negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond \\n amount is that must  be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to \\n support.   No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of  SB \\n 6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid  \\n for purchasing power.    Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for  \\n the California Public Power and Conservation Authority.  However, this can  \\n be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this \\n idea  earlier in the crisis.\\n  \\n SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy\\n At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy.  The \\n first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the \\n governor.  The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is \\n August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier.  According \\n to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has \\n signed it.  The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis \\n and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass.  If the legislature indicates \\n that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary \\n bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash.  \\n \\n The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond \\n issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) \\n stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, \\n then the utilities would receive the residual amount.  In other words, the \\n state will get paid before the utilities.  If this language is included and \\n passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for \\n bankruptcy.  SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and \\n the DWR proportionately from rate payments.\\n \\n',\n",

Although the Chairman \\n began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or \\n answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had \\n some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:\\n \\n Price caps are almost never the right answer\\n Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages\\n Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer\\n Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce \\n demand, is not acceptable\\n Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would \\n export California\\'s problems to the West\\n \\n This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it\\'s a pretty \\n strong anti- price cap position.  Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner \\n out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and \\n if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the \\n agenda.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. \\n March 2000) was absolutely correct.  At this point, it appears that demand \\n over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for \\n temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%.  This translates \\n into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as \\n compared with the previous year.\\n \\n Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary \\n reductions (as opposed to \"forced\" reductions via rolling blackouts).  Other \\n forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making \\n total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June.  \\n This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple \\n more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand.  Given that the 6% \\n decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the \\n retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it \\n is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last \\n year.  This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in \\n Jun-Aug.  In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation \\n are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of \\n meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure.  Finally, the general \\n economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least \\n make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.\\n \\n Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area \\n only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC \\n (U.S.) summer load.  I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO \\n portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in \\n demand.  As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call.  As \\n you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum \\n smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at \\n least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its \\n wish).  This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC.  Several \\n mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are \\n sharply curtailing production.  I have not yet been able to pin down exactly \\n how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue.  \\n Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif\\'s \\n economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West.  While the rest of \\n the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I \\n think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already \\n realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the \\n non-Calif WSCC for this summer.  This would bring the total reduction for the \\n WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around \\n 6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.\\n \\n I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you \\n with updates as new or better information becomes available.  Meantime, I \\n hope this helps.  Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any \\n questions or need any further information.\\n',\n",

Additionally, there are about \\n 500+\\n units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, \\n this,\\n we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious\\n effect on an over leveraged project.  We have therefore adjusted the requested\\n loan amount to $8,868,000.\\n \\n I have summarized our issues as follows:\\n \\n 1.  Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:\\n \\n      Pro-Forma                           Bank's Adjustment\\n      Unit           Unit Rent Rent/BR    Unit Rent      Rent/BR\\n      2 BR/2.5 BA         $1,150          $575           $950           $475\\n      3 BR/Unit      $1,530         $510       $1,250         $417\\n \\n 2.  Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit\\n turn over.\\n \\n 3.  A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).\\n \\n 4.  Based on the Bank's revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support\\n debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x \\n debt\\n coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.\\n \\n 5.  The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.\\n \\n 6.  Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide\\n equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:\\n \\n      Land -                   $1,121,670\\n      Deferred profit& Overhead     $    415,000\\n      Cash Equity              $1,419,268\\n      Total                    $2,955,938\\n \\n 7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage \\n of\\n actual hard construction costs.\\n \\n (See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  - MAPTTRA.xls\\n\",\n",

       " '\\r\\n \\r\\n Jaques,\\n \\n After meeting with George and Larry, it was clear that we have different \\n definitions of cost and profit.  Their version includes the salary of a \\n superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third \\n party subs and materials.  Then there is a layer of \"construction management\" \\n fees of 10%.  There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be \\n paid out of this money.  But I think the majority of it is profit.  Finally \\n the builders profit of 1.4 million.\\n \\n Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out \\n of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit.  After all, if \\n they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors?  \\n We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition \\n to the superintendent costs.  George claims that all of these costs have been \\n in the cost estimates that we have been using.  I reviewed the estimates and \\n the superintendents are listed but I don\\'t think the construction management \\n fee is included.\\n \\n George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard.  I will \\n review and let you know what I think.\\n \\n The GP issues don\\'t seem to be a point of contention.  They are agreeable to \\n the 3 out 4 approval process.\\n \\n Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for  only \\n true costs + 1.4 million.\\n \\n Phillip\\n',\n",
